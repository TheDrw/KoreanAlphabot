# KoreanAlphabot
This is a discord quiz bot used for learning the Korean alphabet for English speakers. It does this by quizzing you in Korean characters, which you then have you translate it into English romanization. You can also change it to be questioned in English romanization, which you then have to answer in Korean characters. The Korean words the bot generates are not supposed to be real words. Although, they can produce real words by chance. Knowing that, this means bad words may arise. So if you know them and you are offended by them, I apologize in advance! I made this bot so I can quiz myself whenever on the computer or on the phone. Hopefully, this bot may help you in some way, whether it be learning Korean or making a bot in python. There are some instances where it is hard to read the Korean words, so that's something to take note of.

You can try it out here on my discord test server : [discord server](https://discord.gg/uFSXutp).<br>
!help will give you a list of the commands. If it is the last week of the month, it is probably not there because the heroku free service I am using will run out of the given time by then. But it will be back up at the start of the month.

I'd also like to note that I am still a beginner in learning the Koreanz, but I think I have certain fundamentals down.
