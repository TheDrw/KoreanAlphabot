# KoreanAlphabot
A discord quiz bot used for learning the Korean alphabet for English speakers. It does this by quizzing you in Korean characters so you'll have you translate it into English romanization. You can also change it to be questioned in English romanization so then you have to answer in Korean. This is the second python project I've ever made, so I am still unsure of certain code nuances/structures, but I think it is...ok.

You can try it out here on my discord test server : https://discord.gg/uFSXutp

I'd also like to note that I am still a beginner in learning Korean, but I think I have certain fundamentals down.
