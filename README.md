# KoreanAlphabot
A discord quiz bot used for learning the Korean alphabet for English speakers. It does this by quizzing you in Korean characters and you have you translate it into English romanization. You can also change it to be questioned in English romanization and you have to answer in Korean. 

You can try it out here on my discord test server : https://discord.gg/uFSXutp
